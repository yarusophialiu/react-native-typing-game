# Warmup exercise: Controlled form fields

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to use controlled form fields
to tie the values of two text input fields together in React.

## Time limit: 15 minutes

## Instructions

1. [Open CodePen for this exercise.](http://codepen.io/moose-horizons/pen/akyorq?editors=0010)
1. There are two text input fields here. When one changes the other should
   change with it and display identical data at all times.
1. Turn input fields into controlled input fields by setting
   `value={this.state.text}` on them.
1. Create a new function `change` inside the class. This function should
   take an `event` argument and update `this.state.text` using
   `this.setState` to `event.target.value`.
